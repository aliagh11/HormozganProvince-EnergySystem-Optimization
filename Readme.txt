In this project the aim is to Optimizing the energy system of Hormozgan province in Iran considering economic and GHG emissions
object functions.

Hormozgan province is one of the most suitable provinces in Iran which has many crude oil and gas fields. 
multi objective optimization (considering 2 object functions) with weighted-sum method is essential because we have 
some power plants and refineries in the province that should be optimized economically and environmentally. 

GAMS software is used to optimize this MIP (Mixed Integer Programming).
